    <h2>How Serious it is?</h2>

    <div>
        <p>A new report recently released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) shows that road traffic deaths continue
            to rise, killing 1.35 million people each year; road traffic injuries in particular are the leading cause of
            death for children and adolescents aged 5 to 29.

            <br> <br> Road safety is an issue that simply doesn't get the attention it deserves - it really is one of
            the great opportunities we have to save lives around the world." So this website will show the number of
            road deaths in the world from 1990 to 2019 in the form of data that will hopefully help countries implement
            strong policies and enforcement so that smart road design, and strong public awareness campaigns can save
            millions of lives in the decades to come.

            <br> <br> This content is based around a discussion of <B>which year A country with a lot of deaths doesn't
                necessarily have a high death rate, it's all about population.</B> There are notes about key countries
            to help
            you to read them.

    <h2>Traffic Deaths Around the World</h2>

    <div id="first_chart"></div>
    <div class="figuretext"><i>World Road Number of Deaths 1990-2019 (Figure 1)</i></div>

    <div>
        <p>The total number of road deaths in the world is very high. This chart records the number of road traffic
            fatalities for almost 30 years from 1990 to 2019. Since 1990, <span class='China'>China</span> has had the
            highest number of road
            deaths in the world at 230,499, and in 2019, still with 25,025 deaths, it continues to be number one.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, with the establishment of road safety laws, <span class='Russia'>Russia</span> has dropped from
            the third highest level of
            fatalities, from 39,298 in 1990, to 20,867 in 2019. This is profound proof that as time goes on and
            civilisation progresses, people will become safer and safer.
            <br><br>
            And since 2019 is the closest in time and has the highest number of deaths, the next are studied around
            2019.

    </div>

    <!----------------------Vegalite 2-------------------------->
    <div id="second_chart"></div>
    <div class="figuretext"><i>Top 20 Countries in Terms of Road Deaths in 2019 (Figure 2)</i></div>

    <div>
        <p>Based on the above information, this content selects the top 20 countries with the highest 2019 fatality
            numbers and compares them side-by-side.
            <br><br>
            As can be seen, <span class='China'>China</span> is far ahead of the following countries in terms of road
            deaths, coming in first with
            a figure of 25,025. second place goes to <span class='India'>India</span> with 21,975. when using the Range
            Selection tool, the
            differences between countries can be seen more clearly and when moving to 42,000, only <span
                class='Brazil'>Brazil</span>, <span class='India'>India</span> and
            <span class='China'>China</span> will remain. Although <span class='Brazil'>Brazil</span> has a small
            population, it is still third in the world in 2019 in terms
            of fatalities, which is something that needs to be continuously improved for the country's road safety
    </div>

    <div id="fourth_chart"></div>
    <div class="figuretext"><i>Top 10 Most Populous Countries in 2019 (Figure 3)</i></div>
    <div>
        <p>Moreover, the number of road deaths and the size of the country's population are also closely related. These
            are the 10 countries with the highest population numbers in 2019.
            <br><br>
            Of these 10 countries, <span class='China'>China</span>, with the highest population, is followed by
            countries such as <span class='India'>India</span> and
            <span class='Indonesia'>Indonesia</span>.
            <br><br>
            When there are too many people, perhaps more deaths are produced, in which <span
                class='Russia'>Russia</span>, which has the smallest
            population compared to the others, also has 20,867 traffic deaths.

    <div class="figuretext"><i>Top 10 Population Road Death Rate in 2019 (Figure 4)</i></div>
    <div>
        <p>Secondly, the number of road deaths and the size of the country's population are also closely related. These
            are the 10 countries with the highest population numbers in 2019.
            <br><br>
            Of these 10 countries, the highest population and highest number of deaths was <span
                class='China'>China</span>, but surprisingly
            <span class='Brazil'>Brazil</span> was first in terms of deaths per million and mortality rate. <span
                class='China'>China</span> has a road fatality rate of
            0.0174, with 174 deaths per million, while <span class='Brazil'>Brazil</span> has a fatality rate of 0.0211,
            with almost 212 deaths per
            million.
            <br><br>
            Combining information from the internet with <span class='Brazil'>Brazil's</span> national context, the
            <span class='Brazil'>Braziian</span> government may be able
            to develop a road management strategy to reduce the number of road deaths among the <span
                class='Brazil'>Brazilian</span> people.
    </div>


    <!----------------------Vegalite 5-------------------------->
    <h2><span class='China'>China</span> <span class='India'>India</span> and <span class='Brazil'>Brazil</span></h2>
    <div id="fifth_chart"></div>
    <div class="figuretext"><i><span class='China'>China</span> <span class='India'>India</span> and <span
                class='Brazil'>Brazil</span> Road Deaths per Million from 1990-2019 (Figure 5)</i></div>
    <div>
        <p>Finally, the three countries with the highest mortality rates are compared on a linear graph. The vertical
            coordinate is ROAD deaths per million and the horizontal coordinate is 1990-2019.
            million.
            <br><br>
            This graph shows that although <span class='China'>China</span> was previously shown to be first in overall
            deaths, averaged out per
            million, the number of deaths in <span class='Brazil'>Brazil</span> is close to the sum of deaths in <span
                class='China'>China</span> and <span class='India'>India</span> in 2019. <span
                class='China'>China</span>, on
            the other hand, peaked in 2004 with an average of 247 deaths per million people.
            <br><br>
            And because of the development of civilisation, the spread of technology and the beginning of road safety
            controls in various countries, the average number of deaths per million in these three countries is also
            slowly decreasing after 2010.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The above also provides profound proof of the main point of our discussion, <b>that countries with higher death
            tolls do not necessarily have higher mortality rates.</b> When we set the number of people at one million,
        <span class='Brazil'>Brazil</span>, which ranked 8th in 2019, was at one point the country with the highest
        mortality rate.

        <br><br>So when we look at the
        number of
        deaths, we have to take into account the population base of the country. At the same time, as culture
        advances,
        technology develops and laws improve, the road fatality rate in every country is gradually decreasing every
        year and
        we hope that every driver and pedestrian will respect the rules of the road and cherish life.

    <div class="description"> <i>According to the World Health Organisation, road traffic injuries caused an estimated
            1.35
            million deaths worldwide in 2016.
            <br><br>
            That is, one person died every 25 seconds. Only 28 countries, representing 449 million people (7% of the
            world's
            population), have appropriate laws for all five risk factors (speeding, drink driving, helmets, seat belts
            and
            child restraints). In low- and middle-income countries, more than a third of road traffic deaths are among
            pedestrians and bicyclists. Yet less than 35% of low- and middle-income countries have policies in place to
            protect these road users. The global average road traffic fatality rate is 17.4 per 100,000 people, with a
            high
            rate of 24.1 in low-income countries and only 9.2 in high-income countries.
            <br><br>
            74% of road traffic fatalities occur in middle-income countries, which account for only 53% of the world's
            registered vehicles. The situation is worse in low-income countries, where only 1% of the world's registered
            vehicles are responsible for 16% of road traffic deaths. These countries are responsible for a
            disproportionate
            number of road traffic fatalities.————Wikipedia</i>
